- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kathleen and I live in Southern Utah.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading books and coding. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React. I spent 2024 teaching myself all I can about web development. I started with basic HTML and CSS, then eventually learned (and still learning) JavaScript,
     along with modules like Flexbox and Grid, frameworks like Bootstrap. I learned about Node/Express. Git/Version Control, APIs, Databases, authentication and security. That's all I can
     remember at the top of my head. I'm not a pro by any means but I am on my way there!
- âš¡ Fun facts about me: I have 44 siblings. I can read a one thousand page book in one day. I took myself sky-diving even though I'm beyond frightened of heights (Yes, I lived.)
